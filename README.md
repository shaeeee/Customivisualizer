# Customivisualizer

Allows modification of player character appearance data, sort of like how Anamnesis lets you change that stuff.
This plugin is pretty lightweight and doesn't cover as many use cases however (the visual change does not show in GPose for example).

* Known issues
  * Everyone in cutscenes will assume the overriden appearance
